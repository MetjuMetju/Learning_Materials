### Boot Process
1. BIOS
2. MBR
3. GRUB
4. Kernel
5. Init
6. Runlevel

###
1. and 2. BIOS (firmware interfaces):
BIOS and UEFI. First, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) program
kicks in once the system powers up.
BIOS uses MBR, UEFI uses GUID Partiotion Table (GPT)  next they runs the power-on self-test (POST).

3. Boot Loader
fdisk -l # check the system partition
Hard drive / USB / CD
types: LILO / SYSILINUX / GRUB2
LILO - obsolete
SYSLINUX supports several major filesystems: FAT, ext2, ext3, ext4, Btrfs and XFS filesystems with some constraints.
GRUB2 - has replaced its past version (GRUB), which is now known as GRUB Legacy.
Has:
- ability to boot multiple operating systems
- boots both a graphical and a text-based interface
- allows ease of use over a serial cable
- strong command line interface for interactive configuration
- network-based diskless booting
sudo grub-install -V

4. Kernel
5. Systemd
6. Run Levels
Runlevel 0	shuts down the system
Runlevel 1	single-user mode
Runlevel 2	multi-user mode without networking
Runlevel 3	multi-user mode with networking
Runlevel 4	user-definable

sudo reboot
sudo init 6 # reboot
sudo shutdown -r now # This will perform a system shutdown in a proper way and then reboot the computer.
sudo shutdown -h now This will perform a system shutdown in a proper way.
sudo poweroff
sudo halt is another way to shutdown.
sudo init 0
