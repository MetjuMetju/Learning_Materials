### ISO/OSI Layers

In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into
seven different abstraction layers:
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

1. Physical Layer:	Cables
2. Data Link Layer:	MAC addresses
3. Network Layer:	IP addresses
4. Transport Layer:	Ports, TCP, UDP, end-to-end communication
5. Session Layer:	Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions
6. Presentation Layer:	Encryption, compression, JPEG
7. Application Layer:	HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS, APIs

### with more examples
1. Physical Layer: Cables, fibers, bits, electrical signals, Wi-Fi frequencies.
2. Data Link Layer: Frames, MAC addresses, switches, bridges, NICs.
3. Network Layer: IP addresses, routers, packets, routing algorithms.
4. Transport Layer: Ports, TCP, UDP, end-to-end communication, flow control.
5. Session Layer: Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.
6. Presentation Layer: Encryption, compression, data format translation, ASCII, JPEG.
7. Application Layer: User interfaces, HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS, APIs.
